  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a shortened form of the original 50-item fat phobia scale. METHOD: The \textregistered rst factor from the original fat phobia scale \DH{} undisciplined, inactive and unappealing \DH{} was identi\textregistered ed as a potential short form of the scale. A new sample of 255 people completed the original 50-item scale. The reliability of a shortened 14-item version of the scale was tested and compared to that of the full scale using both the new sample and the original sample of 1135 study participants. RESULTS: The fat phobia scale \DH{} short form demonstrated excellent reliability in both samples and was strongly correlated with the 50-item scale. Mean and 90th percentile scores are given for both the long and short versions of the scale. CONCLUSION: The shortened fat phobia scale is expected to increase the utility of the measure in a diverse array of research and clinical settings. Future research should focus on developing scale norms for the general population and conducting research on fat phobia in males and among different ethnic groups.},

  abstract = {The Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory (EPSI) is a 45-item self-report measure of eating pathology designed to be sensitive in assessing symptoms among diverse populations of individuals with disordered eating. The current study represents the first external validation of the EPSI as well as the first to examine the factor structure in an outpatient eating disorder clinic sample. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis in three separate samples: an outpatient clinic sample (n\,=\,284), a college sample (n\,=\,296), and a community sample (n\,=\,341) and compared the observed factor structures to the original 8-factor solution proposed by Forbush et al. (2013). We also investigated whether the subscales correlated with the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and a clinical impairment measure among the outpatient clinic sample. Results suggested between 7 and 8 factors for each of the three samples. Our findings largely replicated those of the original EPSI development study, excepting some deviations in the Muscle Building, Cognitive Restraint, and Excessive Exercise subscales. However, confirmatory factor analysis and exploratory structural equation modeling produced poor model fit, which may be related to the item heterogeneity within many of the subscales. Finally, eating disorder attitudes and behaviors assessed by the EPSI were significantly correlated with the EDE-Q and with clinical impairment. Overall, our results highlight both strengths and limitations of the EPSI. Findings provide preliminary support for the use of the EPSI among research with diverse populations, and present several avenues for future research for enhancing clinical utility.},

  abstract = {Many current measures of eating disorder (ED) symptoms have 1 or more serious limitations, such as inconsistent factor structures or poor discriminant validity. The goal of this study was to overcome these limitations through the development of a comprehensive multidimensional measure of eating pathology. An initial pool of 160 items was developed to assess 20 dimensions of eating pathology. The initial item pool was administered to a student sample (N = 433) and community sample (N = 407) to determine the preliminary structure of the measure using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The revised measure was administered to independent samples of patients recruited from specialty ED treatment centers (N = 158), outpatient psychiatric clinics (N = 303), and students (N = 227). Analyses revealed an 8-factor structure characterized by Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Excessive Exercise, Restricting, Purging, Muscle Building, and Negative Attitudes Toward Obesity. Scale scores showed excellent convergent and discriminant validity; other analyses demonstrated that the majority of scales were invariant across sex and weight categories. Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory scale scores had excellent internal consistency (median coefficient alphas ranged from .84\textendash.89) and reliability over a 2- to 4-week period (mean retest r = .73). The current study represents one of the most comprehensive scale development projects ever conducted in the field of EDs and will enhance future basic and treatment research focused on EDs.

Preliminary research indicates that these associations may be complex in nature. This study examined temporal relations among body surveillance, body shame, and eating disorder symptoms in the context of a dissonance-based body image intervention and through 14-month follow-up. College women (N=285) completed assessments at baseline, post-intervention, and at 8-week, 8-month, and 14-month follow-up. Cross-lag panel analyses revealed that changes in body surveillance significantly mediated the association between body shame and ED symptoms over time. Alternatively, body shame did not change over time and was not a significant mediator of associations between body surveillance and ED symptoms longitudinally. Results indicate that the ameliorative effects of dissonance-based interventions may be due to reductions in body surveillance, rather than decreased body shame.},
