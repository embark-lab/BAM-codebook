[["index.html", "Body Advocacy Movement - Study Procedures and Measures Chapter 1 Study Premise 1.1 Specific Aims", " Body Advocacy Movement - Study Procedures and Measures Katherine Schaumberg 2022-09-18 Chapter 1 Study Premise The Body Advocacy Movement Study (Phase 1: 2021-2023) is a pilot study investigating the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an eating disorder risk reduction intervention developed by the EMBARK lab in 2020. While existing, dissonance programs (i.e. the Body Project) target reductions in thin-ideal internalization, fears related to fatness and weight gain may be a particularly salient cognitive target among those with current or past eating disorder symptomatology (Levinson et al., 2014). In an effort to mitigate risk for ED onset and relapse among high-risk young adults (i.e. those in ED partial- or full-remission and/or those with ongoing subthreshold ED symptoms), the current project includes development and initial evaluation of a novel, peer-led intervention that focuses specifically on fear of fatness and anti-fat bias (the Body Advocacy Movement; BAM). This project aims to recruit 60 young adults (ages 18-26) – randomized to a standard dissonance intervention program (the Body Project; N = 20) or BAM (N = 40). Our objective is to examine the degree to which BAM can reduce fear of fatness and weight gain along with internalized anti-fat bias and reduce risk for ED symptom exacerbation and promote ongoing ED recovery in a high-risk, young adult sample. We will evaluate feasibility and acceptability of BAM and estimate effects of the intervention on self-report and behavioral measures of fear of weight gain and fatness, anti-fat bias, and eating disorder symptoms. We will conduct initial effect size comparisons with the Body Project to determine whether BAM shows potency in specifically targeting fear of fatness and anti-fat bias. 1.1 Specific Aims Aim 1: Examine the acceptability and feasibility of BAM in a high-risk young adult sample. Acceptability: Acceptability will be assessed via attrition across a 4-session intervention along with qualitative feedback from a brief survey at post-intervention. We expect to meet benchmarks of high acceptability (average ratings of &gt; 4 [out of 5] on post-intervention survey; &lt; 20% attrition). Feasibility: Feasibility will be benchmarked via intervention adherence (average competency &gt; 8.0 on 0-10 scale) and recruitment goals. Aim 2: Estimate the effects of the intervention on fear of fatness, anti-fat bias, and eating disorder symptoms. We hypothesize that the BAM intervention will result in acute reductions (post-intervention) in fatphobia and anti-fat bias across self—report and behavioral measures, outperforming the Body Project on targets related to anti-fat bias, specifically.

Participants will be randomized to the Body Project (n = 20) or BAM (n = 40). Participants in both groups will complete two peer-led, 2-hour sessions, and complete a series of assessments at baseline, post-intervention, and at 1-month and 6-month follow-up. 2.1 Recruitment Recruitment sources include: (1) University Health Services at UW-Madison and other area colleges and universities (2) flyers at area businesses (e.g. fitness centers, coffee shops) (3) online advertisement on social media platforms (4) direct, peer-to-peer recruitment by peer facilitators, (5) campus e-mail recruitment. "],["interventions.html", "Chapter 3 Interventions 3.1 The Body Project 3.2 The Body Advocacy Movement 3.3 Peer Facilitators. 3.4 Intervention Fidelity.", " Chapter 3 Interventions 3.1 The Body Project We will use a 2-session, peer-facilitated dissonance-based Body Project Intervention, which asks participants to engage in a series of exercises to critique culturally-sanctioned appearance ideals, and specifically targets reductions in thin-ideal internalization (Becker et al., 2006). 3.2 The Body Advocacy Movement BAM leverages both dissonance and exposure-based intervention strategies, adapting common exercises used to promote body acceptance and challenge sociocultural body ideals to specifically target anti-fat bias and internalized fatphobia. Participants in BAM will (1) Define anti-fat bias and fatphobia and explore how these constructs manifest in personal beliefs and interpersonal interactions, (2) Engage in imaginal exposure exercises to challenge fears related to fatness and weight gain (3) Reflect on how fears of fatness align with personal values, (4) Learn new ways to challenge fear of fatness and internalized anti-fat bias and (5) Discuss ways to challenge anti-fat bias on an institutional and societal level. Intervention content. Session 1 will include introductions, discussing identities and clarifying terminology, and an exercise in defining anti-fat bias and fatphobia. Participants will be asked to complete an imaginal exposure exercise several times during the week in which they will write and then recount a ‘worst-case scenario’ of what they might fear could happen if they gained a significant amount of weight. Session 2 will include debriefing the exposure homework and identification of ways one might uproot internalized fear of fatness, along with a series of role plays in which peer facilitators will play the role of a friend or family member in a situation that evokes anti-fat attitudes, and participants will practice challenging these attitudes. Participants will also identify ways to challenge anti-fat bias in society and commit to engaging in one activity to do so in the coming week. As an exit exercise, they will write a ‘response letter’ to their worst-case scenario. 3.3 Peer Facilitators. We will employ a peer-facilitated model of group intervention in this program, where a small group of 6-10 facilitators will undergo an 8-hour training program, similar to Stice et al. (2017). Peer facilitators will train in teams – each peer-leader team will role-play delivery of the entire intervention and observed other peer leaders teams do the same, receiving live clinical supervision. 3.4 Intervention Fidelity. Sessions will be audio recorded and reviewed by two members of research staff. Audio recorded sessions will be rated for fidelity and competence. Research staff will independently code a randomly selected sample of 50% of sessions for implementation fidelity and facilitator competence using checklists assessing the major exercises and discussion topics for each session. Each component will be rated for degree of accurate presentation (10-point scale from “No adherence; the section was skipped” to “Perfect; all material in the section was presented as written”). Facilitator competence will be rated using 12 items assessing indicators of competence (e.g., leaders express ideas clearly and at an appropriate pace, leaders attempt to allot equal speaking time for all members) on a 10-point scale.

You can replicate scoring procedures for a given measure by runnning the scorekeep function with raw data that matches charachteristics of the raw data outlined in each scoresheet. Below is information on measures included in this project and soring procedures employed. 5.1 Childhood Trauma Questionnaire The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) is a standardized self-report inventory that measures the severity of childhood trauma and participants’ tendency to underreport maltreatment, and has been validated in both clinical and non-clinical populations (Bernstein et al., 1997; Villano et al., 2004). The CTQ is a retrospective 28-item self-report inventory that measures the severity of different types of childhood trauma, producing five clinical subscales each comprised of five items: Emotional Abuse, Physical Abuse, Sexual Abuse, Emotional Neglect, Physical Neglect. The measure also includes a three-item Minimization/Denial scale indicating the potential underreporting of maltreatment. Participants respond to each item in the context of “when you were growing up” and answer according to a five-point Likert scale ranging from “never” = 1 to “very often” = 5, producing scores of 5 to 25 for each trauma subscale. The three items comprising the Minimization/Denial scale are dichotomized (“never” = 0, all other responses = 1) and summed; a total of one (1) or greater suggests the possible underreporting of maltreatment (false negatives). 5.1.1 Scoring Scoring for the CTQ includes: Renaming variables with descriptive names Creating sum scores for each subscale (5 items for each of the 5 subscales) Dichotomizing items for the minimization scale Summing dichotimized items to create the minimization score 5.1.2 Key Variables Key summary variables from the CTQ include: ctq_emo_abuse_complete (CTQ emotional abuse subscale sum - completers only) ctq_emo_abuse_NAs (number of NA items in the subscale) ctq_emo_abuse_weighted_sum (CTQ weighted sum of scores contributing to the emotional abuse subscale) ctq_phys_abuse_complete (CTQ pysical abuse subscale sum - completers only) ctq_phys_abuse_NAs (number of NA items in the subscale) ctq_phys_abuse_weighted_sum (CTQ weighted sum of scores contributing to the emotional abuse subscale) ctq_sex_abuse_complete (CTQ sexual abuse subscale sum - completers only) ctq_sex_abuse_NAs (number of NA items in the subscale) ctq_sex_abuse_weighted_sum (CTQ weighted sum of scores contributing to the sexual abuse subscale) ctq_emo_neglect_complete(CTQ emotional neglect subscale sum - completers only) ctq_emo_neglect_NAs (number of NA items in the subscale) ctq_emo_neglect_weighted_sum (CTQ weighted sum of scores contributing to the emotional neglect subscale) ctq_phys_neglect_complete(CTQ physical neglect subscale sum - completers only) ctq_phys_neglect_NAs (number of NA items in the subscale) ctq_phys_neglect_weighted_sum (CTQ weighted sum of scores contributing to the emotional neglect subscale) ctq_minimize (CTQ minimization score - completers only) 5.2 Demographics Demographics caputred in the current study include: Race, Sexual Orientation, Gender, Ethnicity, Student Status, Working Status, Current Living Situation, Assessment Date, and Birthdate. 5.2.1 Scoring We start by cleaning and importing data from the data collection form, which captures demographic variables in this study. We select variables that are part of the data collection form (prefix ‘dcf’) and clean these variables from an original set of 61 variables down to 19 variables to be included in the master dataset. We calculate Age in years and remove birthdate (HIPPA Identifier) from the data set. We change assessment date to only capture month and year of assessment for de-identifiacation. 5.2.2 Key Variables age race ethnicity sex_orientation gender assessment_month 5.3 ED History Questionnaire 5.3.1 Scoring 5.3.2 Key Variables 5.4 ED100k 5.4.1 Scoring 5.4.2 Key Variables 5.5 ED Fear Questionnaire 5.5.1 Scoring 5.5.2 Key Variables 5.6 Eating Pathology Symptom Inventory We used the 45-item Eating Pathology Symptom Inventory (EPSI; (Forbush et al., 2013)) to assess eating disorder symptoms at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 8-week follow-up. The EPSI has been validated in clinical, college, and community samples, with 7-8 subscales in various populations, with the 8-subscale version being the most commonly-employed version of the measure (Coniglio et al., 2018). The 8 subscales includ: Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Purging, Restricting, Excessive Exercise, Negative Attitudes toward Obesity, and Muscle Building. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert-style scale (0 = Never; 4= Often) to describe how well each item describes the participant experiences. Scores are derived by summing responses across the questions included in each subscale. 5.6.1 Scoring To clean the data, the scoresheet: selects only the variables that are relevant for the current measure rename raw variables to appropraite names that are easy to understand creates eight additional variables based on sum scores reflecting eight subscales of the questionnaire: Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Purging, Restricting, Excessive Exercise, Negative Attitudes toward Obesity, and Muscle Building select only a few columns that will go into the final dataset 5.6.2 Key Variables The variables below are sum of different subscales. Sum variables exclude those who did not complete all items of a subscale epsi_body_dissatisfaction (reflects participant’s body dissatisfaction symptoms) epsi_binge_eating (reflects participant’s binge eating symptoms) epsi_cognitive_restraint (reflects participant’s cognitive restraint symptoms) epsi_purging (reflects participant’s purging symptoms) epsi_restricting (reflects participant’s restricting symptoms) epsi_excessive_exercise (reflects participant’s excessive exercise symptoms) epsi_negative_attitude (reflects participant’s negative attidtude towards obesity symptoms) epsi_muscle_building (reflects participant’s muscle building symptoms) 5.7 Fat Phobia Scale - Short Form The shortened Fat Phobia Scale (FPS) utilizes 14 questions to assess fatphobia (from the 50-item original scale). It is intended to measure fat phobia levels in the tested population through various personality traits and whether there is bias when people apply them to an overweight person (Bacon et al. (2001)). The shortened FPS questionnaire demonstrates high reliability when compared to the original 50 question scale. The FPS uses a 5-point sliding scale with 1 being equal to a different negative descriptive variable for each respective question and 5 being equal to a different positive variable for each respective question. Some items are reverse scored prior to data aggregation such that th 1 (negative) to 5 (positive) valuation is maintained across the scale. 5.7.1 Scoring In order to clean the data, the scoresheet: Selects and renames variables to include descriptive terms from questions in the scale Codes all items such that the negative descriptor is labeled as 1 and the positive descriptor is labeled as 5 Computes a mean score using all 14-items 5.7.2 Key Variables fps_mean (average of scores in response to questions asking how different negative and positive descriptors should be applied to a fat person) 5.8 Food Security Questionnaire 5.8.1 Scoring 5.8.2 Key Variables 5.9 GAD-7 5.9.1 Scoring 5.9.2 Key Variables 5.10 Goldfarb Fear of Fat Scale 5.10.1 Scoring 5.10.2 Key Variables 5.11 Ideal Body Stereotype Scale - Revised 5.11.1 Scoring 5.11.2 Key Variables 5.12 PHQ-9 5.12.1 Scoring 5.12.2 Key Variables 5.13 Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire 5.13.1 Scoring 5.13.2 Key Variables 5.14 Traditional Masculinity-Femininity Scale 5.14.1 Scoring 5.14.2 Key Variables 5.15 Universal Measure of Bias - Fat 5.15.1 Scoring 5.15.2 Key Variables 5.16 Weight and Dieting History Questionnaire 5.16.1 Scoring 5.16.2 Key Variables References "],["task-based-measures.html", "Chapter 6 Task-based Measures 6.1 Weight Implicit Association Test (Weight IAT) 6.2 Weight Based Approach Avoidance Task (Weight-AAT)", " Chapter 6 Task-based Measures 6.1 Weight Implicit Association Test (Weight IAT) Weight-IAT task data is housed in its own (long-format) data set within the study database, with keys of subject_id and timepoint. The Weight-IAT is a validated measure of automatic, unconscious attitudes that has previously been used to evaluate implicit weight-related biases (Phelan et al., 2014) The Weight-IAT compares the accuracy of, and time required to categorize images of larger-bodied and thinner people together with positively- and negatively-valanced words. Outcomes include reaction time and percentage of correct categorizations. 6.1.1 Scoring The IAT scoring algorithm involves several steps, with a rigorous scoring procedure involving 12 specifications (Greenwald et al., 2003) Steps include: Using data from Blocks 3,4,6, and 7 Eliminate trials with latencies &gt; 10,000 ms; eliminate subjects for whom more than 10% of trials have latency less than 300 ms Use all remaining trials No extreme-value treatment (beyond Step 2) Compute mean of correct latencies for each block Compute one pooled SD for all trials in blocks 3 &amp; 6; another for blocks 4 &amp; 7 Replace each error latency with block mean (computed in Step 5) + 600 ms No transformation Average the resulting values for each of the four blocks Compute two differences: B6 - B3 and B7 - B4 Divide each difference by its associated pooled- trials SD from Step 6 Average the two quotients from Step 11 R code used for cleaning Weight-IAT data prior to implementing the scoring algorithm is available here - not yet available. R code for completing the scoring algorithm with cleaned data is available here - not yet avaialble 6.1.2 Key Variables 6.2 Weight Based Approach Avoidance Task (Weight-AAT) An interactive task will manipulate congruency between reward- and threat-related outcomes – a task derived from Weaver et al. (2020). Participants learn, through trial-and-error, which of three responses, indicated as geometric shapes, to select to achieve a particular outcome. Critically, each response option is associated with a probability of both a reward outcome (points) and an additional outcome (i.e., images of body parts of those in larger bodies). The response-outcome contingencies (e.g., which option is most likely to lead to reward) switch throughout the task, such that half the time the option that is most likely to lead to reward is also most likely to lead to seeing large body images (Conflict Phase), and half the time the highest reward option is least likely to lead to seeing large body images (Congruent Phase) . Participants are instructed to earn as many points as possible (reward goals), allowing us to test biases in decision-making when large body images are likely. In each trial, participants would choose a shape, and, after a delay (.5-.75s), the point outcome for that trial appeared under the image (presented for 1.5–2.5s) while the image remained on screen, indicating a positive or negative value (e.g., +5 or -7). Trials were separated by a fixation cross, presented for .5-1.5s. The type of image (trauma-related or neutral) and the direction of points (positive, negative) were experimentally manipulated to reflect probabilities that aligned with the type of phase. The number of points won/lost was randomly generated (range: 1-10). Task Phases were not counterbalanced in order to allow for initial task structure learning before the introduction to the Conflict Phase. On all trials, both outcomes (image type, point win/loss) had either an 80%, 50%, or 20% chance of occurring. The image type and point win/loss probabilities were independent from one another. Probabilities for each outcome for the left and right shape (circle and hexagon) were adjusted throughout the task to create the Conflict and Congruent Phases. 6.2.1 Scoring 6.2.1.1 Difference Score We can also create a crude individual difference score to represent discrepancy between the two task phases (Mean Conflict Phase points - Mean Congruent Phase Points), with higher difference score reflecting a higher degree of conflict between the two phases. 6.2.1.2 Linear Mixed Effects Model Code for scoring the Weight-AAT using a Linear mixed Effects Model Approach is available here - not yet available Weight-AAT task data is housed in its own (long-format) data set within the study database, with keys of subject_id and timepoint. The Linear Mixed Effects Model uses trial-wise outcomes (i.e. modeling outcomes on all trials for each participant). Prior to analysis, predictors and outcomes are scaled for analysis including block, Phase (Conflict = -1, Congruent - 1), and Trial (z-scored within each block) and regressed on Total Points (scaled from 0 to 1). Trial is coded to account for learning within block (e.g. trial number 1-25 z-scored to represent linear learning throughout a trial). Ultimate outputs of this model would include a random intercept and random slope for Phase, Block, Trial, and their interactions to account for individual variability – e.g: Points ~ Phase + Trial + Block + Phase * Trial + Phase * Block + Trial * Block + Phase * Trial * Block + Age + Gender + (1+Phase * Trial * Block|sub) To examine BMI differences, a Phase * BMI and Phase * Trial * BMI interaction may also be introduced to the model 6.2.1.3 Drift Diffusion Modeling xxx 6.2.2 Key Variables aat_difference_score : Difference between points obtained during the conflict phases vs. congruent phases of the task aat_phase : Trial Phase (Conflict = -1, Congruent = 1) References "],["sample-description.html", "Chapter 7 Sample Description", " Chapter 7 Sample Description In 2021, we ran a pilot version of this program (N = 29) randomizing young adults to either a 2-session Body Project or Body Advocacy Movement (BAM; described below) intervention (see Figure 1 for Pilot enrollment). Average fear of fatness in the full sample at baseline was similar to samples of ‘repeat dieters’ (Goldfarb Fear of Fat Scale average at Baseline = 23.26), but lower than clinical samples of those with active EDs. A subsample in the second wave of recruitment completed a measure of ED history, with questions specifically assessing ED diagnostic criteria. Among this subsample of participants, 60% reported history of symptoms consistent with a full-threshold ED diagnosis (AN = 33%, BN = 20%, BED = 7%) and an additional 20% reported a history of subthreshold symptoms (Driven exercise to lose weight = 13%, Subclinical BED = 7%).
