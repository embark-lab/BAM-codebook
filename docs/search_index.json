While existing, dissonance programs (i.e. the Body Project) target reductions in thin-ideal internalization, fears related to fatness and weight gain may be a particularly salient cognitive target among those with current or past eating disorder symptomatology (Levinson et al., 2014). In an effort to mitigate risk for ED onset and relapse among high-risk young adults (i.e. those in ED partial- or full-remission and/or those with ongoing subthreshold ED symptoms), the current project includes development and initial evaluation of a novel, peer-led intervention that focuses specifically on fear of fatness and anti-fat bias (the Body Advocacy Movement; BAM). This project aims to recruit 60 young adults (ages 18-26) – randomized to a standard dissonance intervention program (the Body Project; N = 20) or BAM (N = 40). Our objective is to examine the degree to which BAM can reduce fear of fatness and weight gain along with internalized anti-fat bias and reduce risk for ED symptom exacerbation and promote ongoing ED recovery in a high-risk, young adult sample. We will evaluate feasibility and acceptability of BAM and estimate effects of the intervention on self-report and behavioral measures of fear of weight gain and fatness, anti-fat bias, and eating disorder symptoms. We will conduct initial effect size comparisons with the Body Project to determine whether BAM shows potency in specifically targeting fear of fatness and anti-fat bias. 1.1 Specific Aims Aim 1: Examine the acceptability and feasibility of BAM in a high-risk young adult sample. Acceptability: Acceptability will be assessed via attrition across a 4-session intervention along with qualitative feedback from a brief survey at post-intervention. We expect to meet benchmarks of high acceptability (average ratings of &gt; 4 [out of 5] on post-intervention survey; &lt; 20% attrition). Feasibility: Feasibility will be benchmarked via intervention adherence (average competency &gt; 8.0 on 0-10 scale) and recruitment goals. Aim 2: Estimate the effects of the intervention on fear of fatness, anti-fat bias, and eating disorder symptoms. We hypothesize that the BAM intervention will result in acute reductions (post-intervention) in fatphobia and anti-fat bias across self—report and behavioral measures, outperforming the Body Project on targets related to anti-fat bias, specifically. References "],["procedures.html", "Chapter 2 Procedures", " Chapter 2 Procedures We will recruit 100 young adults (ages 18-26) with a self-reported history of an ED and/or current subclinical ED cognitions or behaviors to take part in an intervention to support ED recovery. Participants will be randomized to the Body Project (n = 50) or BAM (n = 50). Participants in both groups will complete four weekly, peer-led, 1-hour sessions, and complete assessments baseline, post-intervention, and at 1-month and 6-month follow-up. We will collect both self-report and behavioral assessments of fear of fatness to test the hypothesis that BAM effectively targets this symptom. Recruitment: Identified avenues for recruitment include: (1) University Health Services at UW-Madison and other area colleges and universities (2) flyers at area businesses (e.g. fitness centers, coffee shops) (3) online advertisement on social media platforms (4) direct, peer-to-peer recruitment by peer facilitators (5) identification of eligible individuals with a diagnosis of an ED that is ‘in partial recovery’ or ‘in full recovery’ with upcoming appointments in the UW-Health system through the UW-Health Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (estimated n ~ 30 eligible individuals/month across clinics) and (6) campus e-mail recruitment "],["interventions.html", "Chapter 3 Interventions 3.1 The Body Project 3.2 The Body Advocacy Movement", " Chapter 3 Interventions 3.1 The Body Project We will use the standard, 2-session dissonance-based Body Project Intervention, which asks participants to engage in a series of exercises to critique culturally-sanctioned appearance ideals, and specifically targets reductions in thin-ideal internalization.19 3.2 The Body Advocacy Movement BAM leverages both dissonance and exposure-based intervention strategies, adapting common exercises used to promote body acceptance and challenge sociocultural body ideals to specifically target anti-fat bias and internalized fatphobia. Participants in BAM will (1) Define anti-fat bias and fatphobia and explore how these constructs manifest in personal beliefs and interpersonal interactions, (2) Engage in imaginal exposure exercises to challenge fears related to fatness and weight gain (3) Reflect on how fears of fatness align with personal values, (4) Learn new ways to challenge fear of fatness and internalized anti-fat bias and (5) Discuss ways to challenge anti-fat bias on an institutional and societal level. Intervention content. Session 1 will include introductions, discussing identities and clarifying terminology, and an exercise in defining anti-fat bias and fatphobia. Participants will be asked to complete an imaginal exposure exercise several times during the week in which they will write and then recount a ‘worst-case scenario’ of what they might fear could happen if they gained a significant amount of weight. Session 2 will include debriefing the exposure homework and identification of ways one might uproot internalized fear of fatness. Session 3 will include a series of role plays in which peer facilitators will play the role of a friend or family member in a situation that evokes anti-fat attitudes, and participants will practice challenging these attitudes. Participants will also identify ways to challenge anti-fat bias in society and commit to engaging in one activity to do so in the coming week. They will also write a ‘response letter’ to their worst-case scenario using information learned over the first three sessions. Session 4 will conclude with discussion of home exercises, continued role-plays, and debrief of the program. Peer Facilitators. We will employ a peer-facilitated model of group intervention in this program, where a small group of 6-10 facilitators will undergo an 8-hour training program, similar to Stice et al. (2017).27 Peer facilitators will train in teams – each peer-leader team will role-play delivery of the entire intervention and observed other peer leaders teams do the same, receiving live clinical supervision. Given the slightly elevated risk profile of those in this study along with the novel, exposure-based components, we will also have a supervising masters- or PhD-level clinician present at (but not leading) group sessions to monitor and respond to any acute concerns. Intervention Fidelity. Sessions will be audio recorded and reviewed by two members of research staff. Audio recorded sessions will be rated for fidelity and competence. Research staff will independently code a randomly selected sample of 50% of sessions for implementation fidelity and facilitator competence using checklists assessing the major exercises and discussion topics for each session. Fidelity and competence will be reviewed after Year 1, with additional target feedback and training for peer facilitators prior to Year 2 groups, as necessary Each component will be rated for degree of accurate presentation (10-point scale from “No adherence; the section was skipped” to “Perfect; all material in the section was presented as written”). Facilitator competence will be rated using 12 items assessing indicators of competence (e.g., leaders express ideas clearly and at an appropriate pace, leaders attempt to allot equal speaking time for all members) on a 10-point scale.

You can replicate scoring procedures for a given measure by runnning the scorekeep function with raw data that matches charachteristics of the raw data outlined in each scoresheet. Below is information on measures included in this project and soring procedures employed. 5.1 Eating Pathology Symptom Inventory 5.1.1 Background We used the 45-item Eating Pathology Symptom Inventory (EPSI; (Forbush et al., 2013)) to assess eating disorder symptoms at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 8-week follow-up. The EPSI has been validated in clinical, college, and community samples, with 7-8 subscales in various populations, with the 8-subscale version being the most commonly-employed version of the measure (Coniglio et al., 2018). The 8 subscales includ: Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Purging, Restricting, Excessive Exercise, Negative Attitudes toward Obesity, and Muscle Building. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert-style scale (0 = Never; 4= Often) to describe how well each item describes the participant experiences. Scores are derived by summing responses across the questions included in each subscale. 5.1.2 Scoresheet To clean the data, the scoresheet: selects only the variables that are relevant for the current measure rename raw variables to appropraite names that are easy to understand creates eight additional variables based on sum scores reflecting eight subscales of the questionnaire: Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Purging, Restricting, Excessive Exercise, Negative Attitudes toward Obesity, and Muscle Building select only a few columns that will go into the final dataset 5.1.3 Key variables The variables below are sum of different subscales. Sum variables exclude those who did not complete all items of a subscale epsi_body_dissatisfaction (reflects participant’s body dissatisfaction symptoms) epsi_binge_eating (reflects participant’s binge eating symptoms) epsi_cognitive_restraint (reflects participant’s cognitive restraint symptoms) epsi_purging (reflects participant’s purging symptoms) epsi_restricting (reflects participant’s restricting symptoms) epsi_excessive_exercise (reflects participant’s excessive exercise symptoms) epsi_negative_attitude (reflects participant’s negative attidtude towards obesity symptoms) epsi_muscle_building (reflects participant’s muscle building symptoms) 5.2 Fat Phobia Scale - Short Form 5.2.1 Background The shortened Fat Phobia Scale (FPS) utilizes 14 questions to assess fatphobia (from the 50-item original scale). It is intended to measure fat phobia levels in the tested population through various personality traits and whether there is bias when people apply them to an overweight person (Bacon et al. (2001)). The shortened FPS questionnaire demonstrates high reliability when compared to the original 50 question scale. The FPS uses a 5-point sliding scale with 1 being equal to a different negative descriptive variable for each respective question and 5 being equal to a different positive variable for each respective question. Some items are reverse scored prior to data aggregation such that th 1 (negative) to 5 (positive) valuation is maintained across the scale. 5.2.2 Scoresheet In order to clean the data, the scoresheet: Selects and renames variables to include descriptive terms from questions in the scale Codes all items such that the negative descriptor is labeled as 1 and the positive descriptor is labeled as 5 Computes a mean score using all 14-items 5.2.3 Key Variables fps_mean (average of scores in response to questions asking how different negative and positive descriptors should be applied to a fat person) References "],["task-based-measures.html", "Chapter 6 Task-based Measures", " Chapter 6 Task-based Measures here are some task based measures "],["sample-description.html", "Chapter 7 Sample Description", " Chapter 7 Sample Description In 2021, we ran a pilot version of this program (N = 29) randomizing young adults to either a 2-session Body Project or Body Advocacy Movement (BAM; described below) intervention (see Figure 1 for Pilot enrollment). A subsample in the second wave of recruitment completed a measure of ED history, with questions specifically assessing ED diagnostic criteria. Among this subsample of participants, 60% reported history of symptoms consistent with a full-threshold ED diagnosis (AN = 33%, BN = 20%, BED = 7%) and an additional 20% reported a history of subthreshold symptoms (Driven exercise to lose weight = 13%, Subclinical BED = 7%), highlighting high potential to reach individuals in ED recovery, which will be bolstered by targeted recruitment efforts. Average fear of fatness in the full sample at baseline was similar to samples of ‘repeat dieters’ (Goldfarb Fear of Fat Scale average at Baseline = 23.26), but lower than clinical samples of those with active EDs.
