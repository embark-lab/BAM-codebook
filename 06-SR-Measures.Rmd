# Self-Report Measures

## Childhood Trauma Questionnaire
The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) is a standardized self-report inventory that measures the severity of childhood trauma and participants’ tendency to underreport maltreatment, and has been validated in both clinical and non-clinical populations [@bernsteinValidityChildhoodTrauma1997; @villanoPsychometricUtilityChildhood2004]. The CTQ is a retrospective 28-item self-report inventory that measures the severity of different types of childhood trauma, producing five clinical subscales each comprised of five items: Emotional Abuse, Physical Abuse, Sexual Abuse, Emotional Neglect, Physical Neglect. The measure also includes a three-item Minimization/Denial scale indicating the potential underreporting of maltreatment. Participants respond to each item in the context of “when you were growing up” and answer according to a five-point Likert scale ranging from “never” = 1 to “very often” = 5, producing scores of 5 to 25 for each trauma subscale. The three items comprising the Minimization/Denial scale are dichotomized (“never” = 0, all other responses = 1) and summed; a total of one (1) or greater suggests the possible underreporting of maltreatment (false negatives).

### Scoring 
Scoring for the CTQ includes: 

1. Renaming variables with descriptive names

2. Creating sum scores for each subscale (5 items for each of the 5 subscales)

3. Dichotomizing items for the minimization scale

4. Summing dichotimized items to create the minimization score

### Key Variables
Key summary variables from the CTQ include: 
`ctq_emo_abuse_complete` (CTQ emotional abuse subscale sum - completers only)

`ctq_emo_abuse_NAs` (number of NA items in the subscale)

`ctq_emo_abuse_weighted_sum` (CTQ weighted sum of scores contributing to the emotional abuse subscale)

`ctq_phys_abuse_complete` (CTQ pysical abuse subscale sum - completers only)

`ctq_phys_abuse_NAs` (number of NA items in the subscale)

`ctq_phys_abuse_weighted_sum` (CTQ weighted sum of scores contributing to the emotional abuse subscale)

## Demographics
Demographics caputred in the current study include: Race, Sexual Orientation, Gender, Ethnicity, Student Status, Working Status, Current Living Situation, Assessment Date, and Birthdate.  

### Scoring 
We start by cleaning and importing data from the data collection form, which captures demographic variables in this study. Data Cleaning steps include: 

1. Selection of variables that are part of the data collection form (prefix 'dcf') and winnow variables to be included in the master dataset. 

2. Calculation of age in years and remove birthdate (HIPPA Identifier) from the data set. 

3. Changing assessment date to only capture month and year of assessment for de-identification.

4. Binning categorical variables to response options most appropriate for 


### Key Variables
`age` (Participant Age in Years)

`race` (Participant Race, recoded to: )

`ethnicity` 

`sex_orientation` (Participant sexual orientation)

`gender`

`assessment_month`

## Eating Pathology Symptom Inventory 

We used the 45-item Eating Pathology Symptom Inventory (EPSI; [@forbushDevelopmentValidationEating2013]) to assess eating disorder symptoms at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 8-week follow-up. The EPSI has been validated in clinical, college, and community samples, with 7-8 subscales in various populations, with the 8-subscale version being the most commonly-employed version of the measure [@coniglioFactorialIntegrityValidation2018]. The 8 subscales includ: Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Purging, Restricting, Excessive Exercise, Negative Attitudes toward Obesity, and Muscle Building. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert-style scale (0 = Never; 4= Often) to describe how well each item describes the participant experiences. Scores are derived by summing responses across the questions included in each subscale.

### Scoring
To clean the data, the scoresheet:

1) selects only the variables that are relevant for the current measure

2) rename raw variables to appropraite names that are easy to understand

3) creates eight additional variables based on sum scores reflecting eight subscales of the questionnaire: Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Purging, Restricting, Excessive Exercise, Negative Attitudes toward Obesity, and Muscle Building

4) select only a few columns that will go into the final dataset

### Key Variables
The variables below are sum of different subscales. **Sum variables exclude those who did not complete all items of a subscale**

`epsi_body_dissatisfaction` (reflects participant's body dissatisfaction symptoms)

`epsi_binge_eating` (reflects participant's binge eating symptoms)

`epsi_cognitive_restraint` (reflects participant's cognitive restraint symptoms)

`epsi_purging` (reflects participant's purging symptoms)

`epsi_restricting` (reflects participant's restricting symptoms)

`epsi_excessive_exercise` (reflects participant's excessive exercise symptoms)

`epsi_negative_attitude` (reflects participant's negative attidtude towards obesity symptoms)

`epsi_muscle_building` (reflects participant's muscle building symptoms)

## Fat Phobia Scale - Short Form 

The shortened Fat Phobia Scale (FPS)  utilizes 14 questions to assess fatphobia (from the 50-item original scale). It is intended to measure fat phobia levels in the tested population through various personality traits and whether there is bias when people apply them to an overweight person (@baconFatPhobiaScale2001). The shortened FPS questionnaire demonstrates high reliability when compared to the original 50 question scale. The FPS uses a 5-point sliding scale with 1 being equal to a different negative descriptive variable for each respective question and 5 being equal to a different positive variable for each respective question. Some items are reverse scored prior to data aggregation such that th 1 (negative) to 5 (positive) valuation is maintained across the scale.

### Scoring
In order to clean the data, the scoresheet:

1. Selects and renames variables to include descriptive terms from questions in the scale
2. Codes all items such that the negative descriptor is labeled as 1 and the positive descriptor is labeled as 5
3. Computes a mean score using all 14-items 

### Key Variables
`fps_mean` (average of scores in response to questions asking how different negative and positive descriptors should be applied to a fat person)

## Goldfarb Fear of Fat Scale
The Goldfarb Fear of Fat Scale (GFFS) which was introduced in 1985 as a diagnostic tool to measure one's fear of fat as it can be an indicator for the development of an eating disorder (Goldfarb et al., 1985). When used as a screening tool for both clinical and non-clinical groups, GFFS has strong test-retest reliability and psychometric properties (Pryzbyla-Basista et al., 2022). In addition, the test also has shown high validity for both populations with and without eating disorders (Goldfarb, 2010). GFFS uses a 4-point scale with 1 being equal to very untrue and 4 being equal to very true, and a 1-factor solution has been supported for scoring.

## Scoring 
Scoring note - we 

1. Select raw variables being used

2. Rename variables to include numbering for order of questions in the scale and recode labels scale to begin at 0 instead of 1 with very untrue being equal to 0 and very true being equal to 3. 

3. Sum the total scores and rename this summary as `gffs_sum`

4. Select only new variables

5. Create a score that is the weighted sum for those who completed at least 75% of items

**NOTE** Our GFFS scoring procedure re-scales the item scores to be 0-3 instead of 1-4, meaning that sum scores are scaled 0-21 instead of 7-28. To compare our means to other studies using the GFFS, add 7 to the sum score.

`gffs_1_fear_fat` (assesses if biggest fear is becoming fat)
`gffs_2_fear_little_gain` (assesses fear of minor weight gain)

`gffs_4_cannot_live` (assesses opinions of how overweight people can live)
`gffs_5_fat_worst` (assesses if becoming fat is worst outcome)
`gffs_6_concentrate` (assesses if concentration on weight control prevents becoming fat)
`gffs_7_painful_thought` (assesses if thoughts of weight gain being fearful can be controlled)
`gffs_8_energy_control_weight` (assesses energy that goes towards weight control)
`gffs_9_eat_lose_control` (assesses fear of losing control when eating)
`gffs_10_stay_hungry` (assesses if staying hungry is meant to prevent becoming fat)
`gffs_sum_complete` (sum of answers for the previous 10 variables)
