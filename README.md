This is the Bookdown for the Body Advocacy Movement Project from the EMBARK lab. The bookdown contains a narrative document to orient readers to the study. For all code related to scoring the measures collected in the project, see the [bam-scorekeep](https://github.com/embark-lab/bam-scorekeep) repository, which houses this code.
